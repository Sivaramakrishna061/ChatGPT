1. What is Cypress and why is it a popular choice for end-to-end testing?
A. It is an open-source JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework which runs directly in browser and closely observe every aspect of the application's behavior;
     Cypress has a simple installation process and use;  Cypress provides automatically waits for elements and assertions to elimating manual waits and sleeps in your test code; 
     Cypress offers powerful debugging capabilities that can pause the test execution at any point and inspect the application's state and behavior & time-travel feature that allows 
     you to see the snapshots at various stages of the test execution; Cypress has provide consistent & deterministic test results by having rich set of built-in API's; Cypress has a  
     large & active community members; Cypress provides a test runner that executes the test code and manage the test lifecycle; Cypress provides built-in assertions for validating 
     the application's behavior and generate test reports to easily analyze the test results; Cypress provides a command line interface for running tests, managing test 
     configurations, and generating reports; It allows you to integration with CI pipleline;

2. How do you handle asynchronous operations and assertions in Cypress tests?
A. To handle the effective tests, must handles asynchronous operations & assertions; When asynchronous elements or operations such as fetching data from an API or wait 
     for an element to appear, Cypress provides intelligently waits until the conditions is satisified; 
     Asynchronous operations can also handled by .then() command, Promises and Async/Await, .should() assertion command;
         (i). .then():- It can perform assertions or further actions using $el that result of previous command;
                  Ex:- cy.get('.element') .then(($el) => { // Perform assertions or further actions using $el });
         (ii). async-await keyword:- Perform assertions or further actions based on the result;
                 Ex:-  it('should handle async/await', async () => {
                                const result = await cy.get('.element');
                              // Perform assertions or further actions based on the result  });
         (iii). .should assertions:- 
                     Ex:- cy.get('.element').should('be.visible');


3. What are custom commands in Cypress, and how do you create and use them in your tests?
A. Custom commads in Cypress will be used to enhancing the reusability of your test code;
     Steps:-
      1. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., 'commands.js') in 'support' folder where it resides in root directory of your Cypress project;
      2. Define Custom Commands in the 'commands.js' use 'Cypress.Commands.add()'; In this command, first parameter is name of the command and second parameter is a 
           function that contains the implementation of the command; Here is 'login' custom command shown below;
             // commands.js
                   Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {
                   cy.visit('/login');
                   cy.get('#username').type(username);
                   cy.get('#password').type(password);
                   cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
                });

        3. Import the Command file in your project's 'index.js' where it is located the 'support' folder;

        4. Cypress can automatically recognize and invoke the command when you need;
            // sample-test.js
                  describe('Sample Test', () => {
                    it('should perform login', () => {
                        cy.login('testuser', 'password');
                           // Perform assertions or further actions after login
                  });
                 });

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
4. How do you handle test data management and parameterization in Cypress?
A. In Cypress, Test data management & parameterization will depends on your specific requirements & preferences;
     Some approaches are:-
      1. Fixture:-  Cypress provides a feature called 'fixture' that allows you to define data from external JSON files; You can create a JSON fixure file containing your test data 
          and load in your test cases using 'cy.fixture()' command;
           // Load fixture data
                  cy.fixture('testdata.json').then((testdata) => {
                           // Use testdata in your tests
                  cy.visit('/');
                  cy.get('#username').type(testdata.username);
                 cy.get('#password').type(testdata.password);
                 cy.get('#login-button').click();
            });


  2. Custom Test Data Objects:-
      If you need more flexibility and readbility of test data, you can create custom JavaScript Objects or modules over the Test case code;
        // Custom test data object
           const testData = {
             username: 'testuser',
             password: 'password123',
             getFullName: function () {
               return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
             },
          };

         // Use test data object in your tests
            cy.visit('/');
            cy.get('#username').type(testData.username);
            cy.get('#password').type(testData.password);
            cy.get('#login-button').click();


 3. Environmental Variables:-
      Cypress supports the use of environment variables which can be used to store & parameterize test data; You can define environment variable either through operating system 
      or by using 'Cypree.env()' command;
         // Set environment variables
               Cypress.env('username', 'testuser');
               Cypress.env('password', 'password123');

         // Use environment variables in your tests
              cy.visit('/');
              cy.get('#username').type(Cypress.env('username'));
              cy.get('#password').type(Cypress.env('password'));
              cy.get('#login-button').click();

 4. Test Data Generation Libraries:-
        If you need to generate complex or randomized test data, you can use third-party libraries such as faker.js, Chance.js and casual.js within your Cypress tests;
        // Use faker.js to generate test data
             const faker = require('faker');
             const randomUsername = faker.internet.userName();
             const randomPassword = faker.internet.password();

       // Use generated test data in your tests
              cy.visit('/');
              cy.get('#username').type(randomUsername);
              cy.get('#password').type(randomPassword);
              cy.get('#login-button').click();

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

5. Can you explain the concept of fixtures in Cypress and how they can be used to load test data?
A. Fixtures are a feature that allows you define test data from external JSON files and load into Test code; Fixtures are typically JSON files that contain structures data such as 
      user information, configuration settings or any other data;
       1. Create a Fixture file (eg.'testdata.json')
            {
              "username": "testuser",
              "password": "password123"
             }

       2. Load the test data into your test, use 'cy.fixture()' command;  'cy.fixture'  is an asynchronous command, so you need to use '.then()' to access the loadded data;
             cy.fixture('testdata.json').then((testdata) => {
              // Use testdata in your tests
              cy.visit('/');
              cy.get('#username').type(testdata.username);
              cy.get('#password').type(testdata.password);
              cy.get('#login-button').click();
             });


6.  How do you handle test environment setup and teardown in Cypress?
A. (i). 'before' and 'after' hook that run once before and after all tests in a test file (i.e., 'describe' block) or a test suite (i.e., multiple describe blocks);
     (ii). 'beforeEach()' & 'afterEach()' hook that run before and after each individual test case (i.e., the 'it' block);

            before(() => { cy.exec('npm run setup:test'); });
           after(() => { cy.exec('npm run teardown:test'); });
           beforeEach(() => { cy.exec('npm run setup:test'); });
           afterEach(() => { cy.exec('npm run teardown:test'); });

           // Test cases
                describe('My Test Suite', () => {
                 // Test case 1
                        it('should do something', () => {  // Test steps.... });
                // Test case 2
                        it('should do something', () => {  // Test steps.... }); 
             });



7. What are some strategies you follow for writing reliable and maintainable Cypress tests?
A. When I comes to writing reliable and maintainable Cypress teste, there are several strategies i can follow;
        1. I spilt tests into smaller units that represents test specific features or functionality;
        2. I gave clear and desciptive names to the test cases; It helps to identify quickly each test case;
        3. I avoid unneccesary dependencies when UI implementations;
        4. Use CSS selector to identify the elements intead of XPath locators;
        5. I added explicit waits and assertions to handle an asynchronous actions;
        6. I used Mocha hooks to setup and teardown across the multiple tests;
        7. I will regularly review and refactor tests;
        8. I will run on various browsers, screen resolutions to catch the potential issues;


8. How do you handle browser-specific interactions and cross-browser testing in Cypress?
A. Cypress Dashboard is a tool which can be used for cross-browsing testing; You can run your tests in multiple browsers and view the results in a centralized dashboard;
    Steps:-
      1. Install Cypress Dashboard;
      2. Create specific test blocks to check the on the browser being used by using 'Cypress.isBrowser()' command;
            if (Cypress.isBrowser('chrome')) {
                  // Chrome-specific interactions or assertions
             } else if (Cypress.isBrowser('firefox')) {
                  // Firefox-specific interactions or assertions
            } else if (Cypress.isBrowser('edge')) {
               // Edge-specific interactions or assertions
             }
       3.  You can define browser-specific configuratons in your 'cypress.json' or 'cypress.env.json'
             {
                 "chrome": {
                                          "browserName": "chrome"
                                   },
                  "firefox": {
                                  "browserName": "firefox"
                  },
                      "edge": {
                                      "browserName": "edge"
                                   }
             }

       4. You can use the 'cypress run' command to execute your tests in multiple browsers;
                    npx cypress run --record --key <dashboard-key>
       5. You can view the results on Cypress Dashboard;


9. Explain the concept of page objects and how they can be implemented in Cypress?
A. Page Objects modal is a design pattern which is used in automation to encapsulate the elements of a web page or application into reusable objects;
Steps:-
 1. Create a page object class such as 'LoginPage.js'  should contains methods and export the Object;
           class LoginPage {
              visit() { cy.visit('/login'); } 
              fillEmail(email) { cy.get('#email').type(email); }
              fillPassword(password) { cy.get('#password').type(password); }
              submit() { cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click(); }
             }
         export default new LoginPage();
 2. Use the Page objects in the tests;
          import LoginPage from '../page-objects/LoginPage';
             describe('Login', () => {
                it('should log in successfully', () => {
                       LoginPage.visit();
                       LoginPage.fillEmail('test@example.com');
                       LoginPage.fillPassword('password');
                       LoginPage.submit();
             // Add assertions or further actions after login
            });
            });


 3. To avoid duplicating selectors across your page object methods, you can centralize the element selectors in a separate file or class;
         // selectors.js
                export const loginPage = {
                                   emailInput: '#email',
                                   passwordInput: '#password',
                                  submitButton: 'button[type="submit"]',
                };
     // LoginPage.js
           import { loginPage } from './selectors';
           class LoginPage {
              fillEmail(email) { cy.get(loginPage.emailInput).type(email); }
              fillPassword(password) { cy.get(loginPage.passwordInput).type(password); }
               submit() { cy.get(loginPage.submitButton).click(); } }



10.  Can you explain the concept of Cypress plugins and share an example of a plugin you have used in your projects?
A.    Cypress pulgins defined as Node.js modules that export a function or an object with specific properties; Here's an example of Cypress plugin adds a custom commands to 
        cypress;

          // cypress/plugins/index.js
                 module.exports = (on, config) => {
                   on('task', {
                      greet(message) {
                            console.log(`Hello, ${message}!`);
                        return null; // Tasks must return a value, so we return null in this case
                    }
           });
     };

    A Custom command called 'greet' takes a 'message' parameter and logs a greeting message to the console and returns 'null';
    A cy.task('greet', 'john') method invokes the 'greet' custom command and passes the 'john' as a parameter to the custom command

       // cypress/integration/my-test.spec.js
              describe('My Test', () => {
                   it('should greet the user', () => {
                      cy.task('greet', 'John').then(() => {
                          // Test assertions or additional actions
                 });
           });
      });


11.How do you handle authentication and authorization in Cypress tests?
A. Handling authentication & authorization in Cypress done by
         1. Use authentication APIs or fixtures:- 'cy.request()' command is used to send HTTP request to those end points and get authentication tokens or session cookies; 
              You can store the cookies or tokens in Cypress 'cy.setCookie()' command or 'cy.window().its('localStorage')';
         2. Use Stub or intercept authentication requests:-
                Use Cypress 'cy.route()' or 'cy.intercept()' commands is used to handle the authentication or authorization;
        3. Use authentication plugins:-
               Cypress provides authentication plugins that can handle authentication process;
               Examples of such plugins include 'cypress-ntlm-auth, cypress-session-auth-plugin, or cypress-keycloak-plugin';


12. What strategies do you follow for handling dynamic elements and wait conditions in Cypress?
A.   Cypress can provides various commands to handle the dynamic elements;
        1. For example, you can use 'cy.get()' with options like '{ timeout: 5000}' to wait for an element to appear on the page; Additionally, you can use the 'cy.wait()' command for 
            network request;
        2. You can use custom wait functions such as setTimeout() or 'cy.clock' to identify the dynamic elements;
        3. To handle dynamic elements, Cypress intercept() commands used if the application relies on network requests to fetch data or update the DOM;
        4. Use assertions .should('be.visible') to ensure an element is visible or disappear;


13. How do you handle API testing in Cypress? Do you have any preferred libraries or approaches?
A.  Cypress Build-in commands such as 'cy.request()' allows making HTTP requests that contains url, http methods, headers, payloads will sent to endpoints and get the 
      response; You can use Chai assertions such as 'expect()' or should() to perform assertions on the response status, headers, JSON bodies or specific data fields;


14. Can you explain the process of integrating Cypress tests into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline?
A.      1. Choose a CI service providers like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI or GitHUb Actions;
          2. Create a configuration file (e.g., '.yml or '.yaml') and add install the dependencies Node.js, Cypress
          3. Clone  the repository from version control system such as GitHub, Bitbucket;
         4. Install project depencies that specified in your 'package.json' file;
         5. Build your application
         6. Run Cypress tests by using Cypress CLI Commands ((npx cypress run or yarn cypress run)
         7. Collect Test Results and determine test status;
         8. You can start the CI Pipleline automatically whenever there is changes in your codebase by using webhook integrations, vesrion control hooks, periodic scheduled runs;

15. What are some best practices for reporting and logging in Cypress tests?
A.  Reporting & Logging in Cypress is a important aspect to visble the test execution, results and any potential issues; There are some practices for reporting & logging in 
       Cypress tests:
         1. Cypress Dashboard is a service tool which provides indetail test results, video recordings, screenshots and advanced reports; It makes easier to analyze & debug test 
             failure;
         2. Cypress allows customize test reports to generate detailed reports; you can use third-party plugins like 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter or cypress-junit-reporter'  to 
              generate visual reports;
         3. Cypress has inbuilt commands cy.screenshot(), which is used to capture screenshots at specific steps on test failure;
        4. Cypress has inbuilt command cy.log(), which is used to provide log relevant information;
        5. Cypress allows third party login libraries such as Log4j, Winston to capture log levels, format of the application;
        6. Cypress has integrate with your CI/CD pipeline,it will generate test reports and artifacts;


16. Can you explain the concept of the Cypress Test Runner and its capabilities?
A.  Cypress Test Runner is a popular JavaScript Based Window that provides creating and executing as well as observing test runs and debugging failures;
      By $npx cypress open command is used to open the Test Runner app; This window allows you to view the page events, page review, snaphots at execution time error log 
      messages and required selectors;

17. Can you explain the concept of the Cypress command line interface (CLI) and its usage?
A. Cypress Command Line interface (CLI) is a tool that allows you to interact with Cypress from the command line or terminal; It provides various commands and options to      
      control test execution and configure settings;
       Steps:-
         1. To install Cypress globally on System, use this command "npm install -g cypress"
         2. To launch the Cypress Test Runner, you can use the following command 'cypress run';
         3. If you want to run tests in headless mode, you can use the following command 'cypress run'
         4. If you want to run specific test files, you can use '--spec' flag option cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/my-test.spec.js"
         5. If you want to run test in specific browser, you can use ' --browser' flag cypress run --browser chrome;


18. What are the different types of assertions and how do you perform assertions in Cypress tests?
A. Assertions are used to validate that certian conditions are met during the test execution and helps ensure that our application behaves as our expectations;
      There are different types of assertions 
        1. Style Assertions:- These are used to verify the CSS Style;
             Ex:- 1. cy.get('.element').should('be.visible');
                     2. cy.get('.value').should('contain', 'Expected Text');
       2. Length Assertions:- These are used to verify the number of elements returned by a Cypress command;
                   Ex:- 1. cy.get('ul li').should('have.length', 5);
       3. Value & Attribute Assertions:- These are used to check the value and attribute of an element;
               Ex:- 1. cy.get('input[name="username"]').should('have.value', 'john_doe');
                       2. cy.get('button').should('have.attr', 'disabled');
      4. Visibility Assertions:- These are used to check whether an element is visibile or hidden;
              Ex:-  1. cy.get('.popup').should('be.visible');
                        2. cy.get('.loading-spinner').should('not.be.visible');
      5. Content Assertions:- Thse are used to verify the content of an element;
               Ex:- 1. cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'Welcome to My Website');
      6. State Assertions:- 
            These are used to check the state of elements such as enabled, disabled, focused etc..,
             Ex:- 1. cy.get('button').should('be.enabled');
                     2. cy.get('input').should('be.focused');


19.Can you describe a challenging scenario you encountered while using Cypress and how you resolved it?
A. I can share common challenge scenario when I used cypress is Asynchronous Operations:
         Asynchronous opeartions can cause flaky tests i.e., tests pass sometimes and fail other times due to varying response time of these operations;
        These challenges are overcome by using explicit waits, retry mechanism, applying the custom assertion and setting global timeout configuration;
