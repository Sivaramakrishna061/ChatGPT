CI/CD Tools:- (16 Questions)

1/1:- 
1. What is Continuous Integration, and how does it differ from Continuous Deployment? Can you describe the key principles and benefits of implementing CI/CD in  
      a software development process?
2. Can you name some popular CI/CD tools? Which ones have you worked with, and what factors do you consider when choosing a CI/CD tool for a project?
3. Walk me through the process of configuring a basic CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based web application. What elements would you typically include in the 
      configuration file?
4. How do you automate the build process in a CI/CD pipeline? Explain the role of build tools such as Maven or Gradle and their integration with CI/CD?
5. What is the purpose of an artifact repository in a CI/CD pipeline? Can you name some popular artifact repository tools, and how do they contribute to the 
     pipeline's efficiency?
6. Describe your approach to integrating automated testing into a CI/CD pipeline. How do you ensure that tests are executed reliably and provide meaningful 
     feedback?
7. How do containers (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) fit into a CI/CD pipeline? Explain their roles and benefits?
8. Discuss different deployment strategies used in CI/CD, such as blue-green deployment, canary deployment, and rolling deployment. When would you choose one 
     strategy over another?
9. How do you incorporate monitoring and logging into a CI/CD pipeline? What tools or practices do you use to ensure visibility into the pipeline's performance and 
      health?
10. What security considerations should be taken into account when setting up a CI/CD pipeline? How do you handle sensitive information, such as API keys or 
       credentials, in a secure manner?
11. How do you handle maintenance and updates for a CI/CD pipeline over time? What challenges might arise, and how do you address them?
12. When dealing with large and complex projects, What strategies do you use to scale CI/CD pipelines efficiently? How do you ensure quick feedback without 
        sacrificing quality?
